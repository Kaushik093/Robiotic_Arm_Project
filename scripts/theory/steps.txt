Steps : 

Forward kinematics :

1. Arm matrix : matrix that maps frame k to frame k-1 coordinates.

Transformations [NEED FOR DH PARAMETERS] :
rotate Lk-1 by theta about zk-1 , translates by d along z axis, translates by a along x axis
and rotates by alpha wrt x axis.

2.Get position vector from base to tool tip and orientation of tool wrt base.


INVERSE KINEMATICS:

 Unique solutions are rare, multiple solutions exist.

 From the final position vector 6 independent equations are there to solve for q1 to qn.  If n=7 it cannot be solved as there are only 6 equations.

Existence of a solution: Solvable if all joint variables can be found corresponding to a particular end effector location
