Steps : 
1. Arm matrix : matrix that maps frame k to frame k-1 coordinates.

Transformations [NEED FOR DH PARAMETERS] :
rotate Lk-1 by theta about zk-1 , translates by d along z axis, translates by a along x axis
and rotates by alpha wrt x axis.

2.Get position vector from base to tool tip and orientation of tool wrt base.
